3. I've been working as a Web Developer for 2 years now but unfortunately I didn't have any exposure to new technologies at work. I am constantly trying to develop in my spare time, however, it's hard with a little child. One day I'd love to become an independent freelancer. I'm planning to live in a small village on Sicily with my family and work remotely for international clients.
4. I am mostly confident with my HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap and JS skills. I'm trying to improve my React skill whenever I can. In my previous job I had a bit of exposure to SQL and procedural PHP and I tried out Laravel in my free time, which helped me understand OOP and MVC architecture better. In my current job, backend is done in Ruby on Rails and I sometimes need to reach out there and work with it. I know SVN and GIT, I've used both GitHub and GitLab. I also used Postman and Insomnia for testing Rest APIs. I know a bit about Google Analytics as well.

8. My English is probably on B2/C1 level. I'm living and working in UK and I use it on daily basis.
