## About me
I've been working as a Web Developer for 2 years now but unfortunately I did not have any exposure to new technologies at work. I am constantly trying to develop in my spare time, however, it is hard with a little child. One day I would love to become an independent freelancer, live in a small village on Sicily with my family and work remotely for international clients.

* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* Bootstrap
* JS
* React (still at beginner's stage)
* PHP & SQL (know basics from my previous job)
* Laravel (basic level)
* Ruby on Rails (learning basics at my current job)

### Methodologies
* OOP
* MVC
* Functional Programming

### Tools/versioning
* Postman, Insomnia
* GIT
* SVN
* GitHub/GitLab
* Firebase
